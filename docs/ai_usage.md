Throughout this notebook, AI assistance was used to help with various tasks, including:

Generating initial code snippets based on task descriptions (e.g., printing "hello world", assignment operator examples, type() examples, file writing, Biopython usage).
Explaining code concepts and the purpose of different functions or methods.
Diagnosing and fixing errors in existing code cells (e.g., fixing syntax errors, addressing TypeErrors by suggesting correct usage of functions or object types).
Modifying existing code cells to meet new requirements (e.g., changing print formats, using different methods like Biopython's Seq).
Generating code to solve specific problems like those from Rosalind.
Suggesting alternative or simpler ways to achieve a task (e.g., using list slicing for even lines).
Providing explanations for Rosalind problems when the user provided the problem description.
Essentially, the AI helped by providing code solutions, explaining concepts, and debugging issues as you worked through the bioinformatics tasks.
